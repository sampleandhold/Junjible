The Junjible website.

This web application is written in Noir.
All the UI design, JS, layout, and Noir by Edward Raison, who also did a lot of the Clojure in the template files.
Tom Marble, the brains behind the system, and Kevin Raison, the Lisp Guru, helped him out greatly and broke him in on Lisp-like syntax.  Thanks guys!
